We have a new layout! See https://thoufer.github.io/harvestVis_demo/harvest-vis.html for harvest data & map visualizations and  https://thoufer.github.io/harvestVis_demo/wing-id.html for the duck wing identification page with videos.



You can still access the old layout although the style has been changed so things may not look as they should.
